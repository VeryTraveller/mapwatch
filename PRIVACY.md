Here's a complete list of privacy-related things Mapwatch does with your data:

* Mapwatch tells Google Analytics how long you've spend on the page, and when you finish a map. Google Analytics uses cookies. The Mapwatch developer's goal here is to see averages of all Mapwatch users, and to gather debugging information; it's not shared. If Google Analytics tracking bothers you, [feel free to turn it off.](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)
* Mapwatch uses `localStorage` (like cookies) to store your preferences across visits, like text-to-speech volume. This storage is merely for convenience, and isn't used for any sort of tracking. If cookies bother you, [feel free to have your browser block/clear Mapwatch's cookies and storage.](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647)
* Optionally, Mapwatch allows you to export your data to a Google spreadsheet. This means logging in to your Google account, and sending your Mapwatch map runs to Google Sheets. Non-map information from your `client.txt`, like chat, is not sent to Google Sheets (or anywhere else). Spreadsheets created this way are not shared; the Mapwatch developer has no way to see them. If connecting Mapwatch and Google bothers you, avoid logging in to Google from Mapwatch.
  * You can also export your Mapwatch data as tab-separated values - no login required.
