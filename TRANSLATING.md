## Translating Mapwatch

Thanks for your interest in translating Mapwatch! The Mapwatch developer can automatically translate PoE log files, but translating the rest of the Mapwatch interface is only possible with your help.

[To get started, visit our translation UI!](https://erosson-pontoon.herokuapp.com/projects/mapwatch) 
The first page load may take a while. Also, this is not very well tested - let me know if it breaks!

---

To translate manually, without the translation UI:

[Here's the original English translation file, written by the Mapwatch developer.](https://github.com/mapwatch/mapwatch/tree/master/packages/www/public/localization/en-US/mapwatch.ftl)
A complete translation converts all text in that file.

[Here are all of Mapwatch's translation files.](https://github.com/mapwatch/mapwatch/tree/master/packages/www/src/public/localization/)
You'll need to create one of these files for your language. These are [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/) files.

Once your translation's complete, [send it to the developer](https://github.com/mapwatch/mapwatch/issues)!

Partial translations are still useful - if any lines are missing, we'll fall back to the English version.

[This link](https://mapwatch.erosson.org/?debugLocalized=1) highlights all translatable text - if you find any text there that *isn't* highlighted, it can't yet be translated. Also, spreadsheet exports cannot yet be translated.

If you have questions for the developer while translating, [feel free to ask](https://github.com/mapwatch/mapwatch/issues). Once you're done translating, [let the developer know](https://github.com/mapwatch/mapwatch/issues). Thanks so much for your help!
